# 🔍 Forensic Analyzer (Work in Progress)

This is a small project I am currently building.  
It is a simple **browser-based forensic tool** made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Right now, the project is still under development, and I will keep adding more features as I learn.

---

## 📌 Current Features 

✔ Hash Generator (MD5, SHA1, SHA256)  
✔ Base64 Encode / Decode  
✔ Many additional encryption and decryption tools will be included in the future. 

These tools are basic but useful for learning digital forensics and simple analysis tasks.

## 🚧 Upcoming Features (Planned)

- EXIF metadata viewer  
- File upload → hash generator  
- Better UI design  
- More forensic tools    
The following features are planned and will be added as the project evolves.
